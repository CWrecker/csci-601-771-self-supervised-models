<!-- Intro -->
<div class="container sec" id="intro">
    <p>
        The rise of massive self-supervised (pre-trained) models has transformed various data-driven fields such as
        natural language processing, computer vision, robotics, and medical imaging.
        This advanced graduate course aims to provide a holistic view of the issues related to these models: We will
        start with the history of how we got here, and then delve into the latest success stories. We will then focus on
        the implications of these technologies: social harms, security risks, legal issues, and environmental impacts.
        The class ends with reflections on the future implications of this trajectory.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Prerequisites</strong>:
        Students must have extensive experience with deep learning, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and
        natural language processing.
        <!--  Fluency with linear algebra, statistics and one of the Deep Learning libraries (PyTorch, Tensorflow, JAX, etc.) is highly recommended.--->
        Familiarity with linear algebra, statistics and probability are necessary, as well as with the design and
        implementation of learning models (via one of the learing libraries, such as PyTorch, Tensorflow, Keras, JAX).
        Students must be comfortable with reading papers and extracting key concepts and ideas from papers.

    <h2>Content</h2>
    <p> For much of the semester, each class will involve the presentation and discussion of recent important papers on
        pre-trained (self-supervised) statistical models.
        <!--        The bulk of this class will comprise of talks from researchers discussing latest breakthroughs with transformers-->
        <!--        and explaining how they apply them to their fields of research.-->
        The objective of the course is to instill a holistic view of the latest developments in various fields (NLP,
        computer vision, biology. etc.), and help the participants understand their broad implications.
    </p>

    <p>
        Each paper will be presented by a group of students each with an assigned <a
            href="https://colinraffel.com/blog/role-playing-seminar.html">"role"</a>. This role defines the lens
        through which they read the paper and determines what they prepare for the group in-class discussion.
        Here are the roles we will experiment with:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Stakeholder ‚úçÔ∏è:</b> Act as if you're the authors of this paper. Describes their motivation, problem
            definition, method and experimental findings of this paper.
        </li>
        <li><b>Scientific Peer Reviewer üë©üèΩ‚Äçüî¨:</b> Act like you're a reviewer of this work. Be critical of the work,
            though not necessarily
            negative. You can follow the guidelines for <a
                    href="https://nips.cc/Conferences/2020/PaperInformation/ReviewerGuidelines"> NeurIPS reviewers</a>
            (under "Review Content"), taking note of the example reviews included therein.
        </li>
        <li><b>Archaeologist üè∫:</b> Determine where this paper sits in the context of previous and subsequent work.
            Find
            and report on one prior paper that substantially influenced the current paper and one newer paper that cites
            this current paper.
        </li>
        <li><b>Visionary üî≠:</b> Propose an imaginary follow-up research project or a new application -- not just based
            on the current but only possible
            due to the existence and success of the current paper.
        </li>
        <!--        <li><b>Researcher üçú:</b> Propose an imaginary follow-up project &#45;&#45; not just based on the current but only possible-->
        <!--            due to the existence and success of the current paper.-->
        <!--        </li>-->
        <!--        <li><b>Practitioner üñ•Ô∏è:</b> Propose a new application for the method in the paper (not already discussed in class),-->
        <!--            and discuss at least one positive and negative impact of this application.-->
        <!--        </li>-->
    </ul>
    <p>
        The presentation of each role can be done individually or in groups of ‚â§3. If done as a group, you and your
        partner
        should decide how to equally divide the work for a given paper presentation session.
    </p>
    <p><b>Who presents what role and when?</b> At the beginning of the semester, students will be divided into two
        halves,
        one half presenting on Tuesdays and the other on Thursdays.
        <!-- we will split the class into two groups: one group present presents on Tuesdays and the other group presents on Thursdays.-->
        In a given class session, the students in the presenting half will each be given a random role (determined the
        week before at the end of the classes).
        Each role group (irrespective of how many students are assigned to it) should aim for 10 mins presentation.
        You're encouraged to have slides for your role, though it is not mandatory.
        <!--        You should present your findings with a formal presentation, i.e., have some slides prepared for the group-->
        <!--        in-class discussion.-->
        <!--        Your assigned role determines what you should include in the slides.-->
        If you do so, I would recommend less than 5-8 slides to make sure stay within our time budget.
    </p>
    <p><b>What slides?</b> To minimize time spent context switching or fighting with screen sharing/projector dongles,
        we will have a shared pool of slides (hosted on Google presentations, will be shared a week before).
        Each role group are encouraged to title their slides with "<span
                style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">[role emoji]: [student name]</span>" (as in "<span
                style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">üè∫: Jane,John</span>")
        so that the slides are quickly identified during the session.
        If you choose to make slides, you're <b>not</b> expected to
        prepare a full-blown presentation -- they're encouraged for visual aid and facilitating the presentation.
    </p>
    <p><b>What about the non-presenting half?</b>
        While only a subset of the class will participate in presenting a paper, the rest of the class is expected to
        come to class ready to participate in the discussions.

    <h2>Project</h2>
    <p>
        All students in the class will write a "mini-paper" as a final project. The topic of this project is open-ended.
        This project, for example, can focus on demonstrate systemic limitations of a prior work
        or suggesting improvements on methods or benchmarks discussed in the class.
        <!--        reproducing one or more papers covered in the class (or relevant works)-->
        <!--        or extending them.-->
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Group work:</b> Students are expected to work in groups on the final project (team sizes limited to 2 or
            3 people). Students in groups are required to include a ‚Äúcontributions‚Äù section concretely lists each
            author‚Äôs contributions (see Section 8 of this paper, for example). The length of the final report should be
            5 to 8 pages. Note that longer reports are not necessarily better.
        </li>
        <li><b>Project proposals:</b> All groups will be required to submit a project proposal by the start of class on
            TBD. The project proposal is a single-paragraph description of what you intend to do (experiments, datasets,
            methods, etc.) The instructors will provide feedback on these ideas to help the teams with finding a
            concrete idea. There will be lightning presentations of the finalized proposals on TBD.
        </li>
        <li><b>Midway progress presentation:</b> Groups will present their halfway progress during a mid-way project
            presentation. This is expected to be a short presentation discussing the progress made for each project and
            any remaining hurdles.
        </li>
        <li><b>Final presentation:</b> The final project presentation will be during the final exam period. All students
            in each group are required to present some material during the final presentation.
        </li>
        <li><b>Final Report:</b> Students should write code and carry out additional experiments and then write up the
            results in a standard conference paper format (<a
                    href="https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/neurips-2022/kxymzbjpwsqx">template</a>). The final

        Since this is a discussion class, it's especially important that we respect everyone's perspective and input. In
        particular, I value the perspectives of individuals from all backgrounds reflecting the diversity of our
        students. I will strive to make this classroom an inclusive space for all students. Please let me know if there
        is anything I can do to improve.

        This course will have a zero-tolerance philosophy regarding <a
            href="https://www.cs.jhu.edu/academic-programs/academic-integrity-code/">plagiarism or other forms of
        cheating</a>, and incidents
        of academic dishonesty will be reported. A student who has doubts about how the Honor Code applies to this
        course should obtain specific guidance from the course instructor before submitting the respective assignment.
